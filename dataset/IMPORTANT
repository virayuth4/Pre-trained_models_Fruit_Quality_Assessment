'''
PREREQUISITE: the fresh apple data is misnamed as "FreshOrange" instead of "FreshApple", so before
splitting the dataset you can run:

  directory = "/path/to/your/directory"
  for filename in os.listdir(directory):
    if filename.startswith("FreshOrange") and filename.lower().endswith(".jpg"):
        # Construct the old and new file paths
        old_file = os.path.join(directory, filename)
        new_file = os.path.join(directory, "FreshApple" + filename[len("FreshOrange"):])
        # Rename the file
        os.rename(old_file, new_file)

to replace all the "FreshOrange" as "FreshApple"
